# README

Grozhers is a grocery list app built around groups.
The idea is that users can join or create groups so that they can share a common
grocery list with all members of the group.

### Walkthrough

1. The user should sign up if this is their first time, or sign in if they have
used the app before
2. If the user does not have any groups, they will be redirected to the **Create
/ Join Group** page.
3. The user should either create a new group or join an already existing group.
4. The user will then be taken to their group's page.
  * The group's page shows the list of items (which can be taken off the list by
    clicking **Purchased**).
  * There is also a form for adding items to the list
